# About us

We are a team of young and vibrant accountants and bookkeepers. We are committed to crunch your numbers, debits and credits, but more importantly we aim to work to support your business and your strategy.

We have experience in various industries, publishing, services, hospitality and beauty, just to name a few.

One of the advantages to work with us is that we provide a comprehensive analysis of your current financial position, which allows us to choose the strategy just right for your business providing services from which you’d benefit.

The principles that we work by are accountability, trust, confidentiality and professional behaviour. Our work culture is to maintain a supportive and open environment, where we encourage leadership, personal and professional growth, and give a chance to every opportunity that knocks on our door.

Education is our passion, hence a significant share of our work is dedicated to training. We wish to share the knowledge and experience, therefore we are developing a set of short courses for young start ups to assist them to succeed.

All in all, we are pretty cool, so give us a call to discuss how we can work together.
